# ***This work is in progress.***

## Introduction
**[NURBS-Diff](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448522000045)** is a nerual network differentiable programming module for NURBS, and **[LNLib](https://github.com/BIMCoderLiang/LNLib)** is a C++ NURBS Algorithms Library on Github. **NURBS-Diff-with-LNLib** is a simplified reproduction for NURBS-Diff by using LNLib.

## Run NURBS-Diff-with-LNLib
- Download Libtorch from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. (For example: local-download folder is C:/Code/CodeReference/)
- Reset Libtorch Path in CMakeLists.txt (from **src** folder) up to your Libtorch download path.
- Run build.bat to construct C++ solution by CMake.
